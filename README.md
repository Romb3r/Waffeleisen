## Auto-Versioning

This repository is configured with automatic version incrementing using GitHub Actions. The versioning strategy depends on the type of change:

### Versioning Strategy

This repository implements a comprehensive semantic versioning strategy:

- **ðŸ”´ Major version increment**: When creating a tag (e.g., `1.2.3` â†’ `2.0.0`) See tag creation below.
- **ðŸŸ¡ Minor version increment**: When merging into `main` or pushing directly to `main` (e.g., `1.2.3` â†’ `1.3.0`, patch resets to 0)
- **ðŸŸ¢ Patch version increment**: When pushing to any feature branch (e.g., `1.2.3` â†’ `1.2.4`) When a merge conflicts occures, use web editor to resolve. Resolve as you like since the version of the main branch will be taken.

### How it works

- **Feature branches**: Each push increments the patch version on that branch
- **Main branch**: Merges/pushes increment minor version and reset patch to 0
- **Tags**: Creating any tag increments major version and resets minor/patch to 0
- The current version is stored in `version.txt`
- Version updates are committed automatically with the message pattern: `Auto-increment version to X.Y.Z [major/minor/patch] [skip ci]`

### Tag Creation

**Manual Release Workflow**
Use the "Create Release Tag" workflow in GitHub Actions:
1. Go to Actions â†’ "Create Release Tag" â†’ "Run workflow"
2. Choose release type (major/minor/patch)
3. Add optional tag message
4. Creates properly versioned tag with updated code

# Git usefull commands

#### Merge from main into branch:
```
git checkout <feature_branch_name> && git rebase main
```
**Make sure to do a git pull in main before.**
